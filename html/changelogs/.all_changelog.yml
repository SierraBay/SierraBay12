  Hubblenaut:
  - tweak: Reduces the transparency of the on-mob Security Aviator sprite.
  - bugfix: Fixes the smart revolver shooting practice beams.
  Jux:
  - tweak: In prefs, character gender has been divided into "bodytype" and "pronouns.
  - tweak: Pronouns for most mobs can now be set separately from their gender.
  - tweak: Mobs of a different faction will no longer recognize each other unless
      introduced with the new "introduce" verb.
  - bugfix: Ghosts recognize everyone again.
  SierraKomodo:

      both coils changing when you place a cable, and cut cables being red.

  - admin: Connecting clients are now checked for association with other known users
      and active bans. Any matches are displayed as debug logs for testing purposes.
  - tweak: Anchoring/unanchoring objects with a wrench has been refactored with some
      standardized sanity checks.
  - admin: Added buttons to the Player Panel to look up matching known prior connections
      and matching active bans for a given mob. Currently intended for ease of debug
      use, but should be accurate for admin purposes. Requires ADMIN perms for now.
  cuddleandtea:
  - admin: Light maker power shouldn't be more than 1
  - sounddel: Vent pump humm is now more quiet
