changes:
  - tweak: A majority of tool interactions now, by default, require the tool to remain
      in your active hand, both you and the item (If not in hands) to remain next
      to the target, and you to be able to physically interact with the target to
      complete if there is a timer, prompt, or any other pause in the process.
