  - rscadd: Mech wreckage now uses standardized health and damage.
  - rscdel: AI can no longer remotely unlock a fireaxe cabinet.

      window instead of chat.

      or performing other interactions with structures that replace them with a new
      instance.
  - tweak: Harmful grab actions on structures, such as bashing people against the
