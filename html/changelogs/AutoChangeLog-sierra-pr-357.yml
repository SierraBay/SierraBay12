changes:
  - bugfix: Empty small parcels can now be opened to reveal they are empty. This deletes
      the parcel.
  - tweak: Parcels now have 5 hit points and can be damaged by standardized health
      sources. Any damage parcels take will also be applied to their contents. Paper
      wrapping isn't armor.
