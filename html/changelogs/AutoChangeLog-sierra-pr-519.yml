changes:
  - bugfix: Brick stacks are now bricks instead of appearing as sheets.
  - tweak: The generation of icon states for material stacks has been reworked. Aside
      from the bugfix and tweak, there should be no real user-facing changes.
  - tweak: Stacks of reinforced materials now use the reinforced material's color
      in the visible lattice work.
