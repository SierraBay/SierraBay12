changes:
  - tweak: Laser Scalpels and Incision Management Systems should no longer prompt
      with a menu each time they are used. Exceptions may apply to specific surgery
      steps.
  - tweak: Advanced Laser Scalpels have been renamed to just Laser Scalpels in the
      Protolathe. They are now a guaranteed improvement over the basic version, for
      most use cases.
  - rscdel: Basic and Improved Laser Scalpels have been removed. Tech levels have
      been adjusted to compensate.
