changes:
  - tweak: Service borgs can hold smokeables (pipes/cigarettes/etc.) and other objects
      from the Rapid Service Fabricator.
  - tweak: Borgs can use Ctrl+Alt+Click as a shortcut to point at things. The shortcut
      for borgs and AI to electrocute doors has been moved to Ctrl+Shift+Click (on
      harm intent).
