changes:
  - tweak: Exoplanet atmospheres are more varied now, with a wider, but more grounded
      temperature range and less non-terraformed planets with ideal atmospheres.
  - tweak: All exoplanet types can now generate with all templates - volcanic cities,
      for example.
  - tweak: Thermal energy in gas mixtures is gained significantly slower the hotter
      the mixture is.
