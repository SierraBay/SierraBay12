changes:
  - admin: Associated ban checks now ignore job bans.
  - admin: Logs for connections and bans found on clients now appear as staff logs
      instead of debug logs. Messages for found bans are in red.
  - admin: Checks on connecting clients are now skipped if the server is performing
      initialization, to avoid causing connection failures or other lag-related issues.
