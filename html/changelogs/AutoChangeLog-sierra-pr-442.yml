changes:
  - bugfix: SEV Torch Deck 3 no longer loses pressure during round start.
  - bugfix: Organs within limbs now probably drop onto the ground when the limb is
      destroyed/dropped.
  - bugfix: Cameras now kick you out of their view in the camera app when they are
      deleted, instead of locking you in a black screen.
  - tweak: Leaping with a missing limb now has a chance of toppling you over.
