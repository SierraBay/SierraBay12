changes:
  - bugfix: Performing crafting on an item inside a storage container (Backpack, box,
      etc) now properly removes the targeted object and places the new crafted item
      in the bag, if applicable.
  - bugfix: Reinforced material stacks no longer display their reinforcement material
      twice in their name. `Steel-Reinforced Steel-Reinforced Glass Sheets` -> `Steel-Reinforced
      Glass Sheets`.
  - bugfix: Maintenance drones no longer die when traveling through disposals.
  - bugfix: Using an ID on a bot with an open panel no longer displays two feedback
      messages.
  - bugfix: Blob tendrils now have fingerprints added to them when successfully harvested.
  - bugfix: Repairing borgs now actually works, instead of always saying 'The object
      does not exist'.
  - bugfix: External limb that are right on the edge of being irrepairable now actually
      display as such when scanned, instead of showing 'Extreme'.
